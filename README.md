# ImageRecognitionMNIST - Classification with PyTorch

This project demonstrates a basic approach to classifying handwritten digit images (MNIST) using two neural network models:

- **SimpleNN** — a simple fully connected neural network  
- **CNN** — a convolutional neural network (better suited for image data)

---

## What does this project do?

- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset  
- Trains both models on the training set  
- Evaluates their performance on the test set  
- Compares accuracy and loss between the two models

## How to get started?

1. Install required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
    ```
2. Run main script.
