# Digit Recognizer ‚Äì Compare Models & Predict by Drawing
## (Manual Linear Regression + Neural Nets + GUI)

A simple but flexible playground for testing different machine learning models on the MNIST digit recognition task ‚Äî including a handwritten Linear Regression from scratch (no PyTorch autograd), feedforward neural networks, and CNNs.

Comes with a live GUI where you can draw digits and see real-time predictions from trained models.

## üîç Features

- Manual linear regression from scratch (no libraries, just math!)
- Comparison of multiple models (SimpleNN, CNN)
- Automatic training & testing pipeline with accuracy/loss plots
- Model saving & loading
- GUI: draw a digit and get instant prediction
- CLI-based prediction from image files
